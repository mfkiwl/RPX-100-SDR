<h1>Star Tracker Feature Plugin</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Star Tracker feature plugin is for use in radio astronomy and EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) communication.

* It calculates the azimuth and elevation of celestial objects and can send them to the Rotator Controller or other plugins to point an antenna at that object.
* It can plot drift scan paths in both equatorial and galactic charts.
* The overhead position of the Sun, Moon and selected star can be displayed on the Map Feature.
* It can display local Sidereal time, solar flux density and sky temperature.
* It can plot the line of sight through the Milky Way.
* The plugin can communicate with Stellarium, allowing Stellarium to control SDRangel as though it was a telescope and for the direction the antenna is pointing to be displayed in Stellarium.

<h2>Settings</h2>

![Star Tracker feature plugin GUI](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_plugin.png)

<h3>1: Start/Stop plugin</h3>

This button starts or stops the plugin. The plugin will only calculate azimuth and elevation or communicate with Stellarium when started.

<h3>2: Find target on map</h3>

Pressing this button centres the Map Feature (if open) on the current target.

<h3>3:Download Solar flux density data</h3>

Pressing this button downloads the Solar flux density data from the DRAO and Learmonth Observatories.

<h3>4: Set latitude and longitude from My Position</h3>

When clicked, it sets the latitude, longitude and height fields to the values from SDRangel's My Position preferences.

<h3>5: Show settings dialog</h3>

Pressing this button displays a settings dialog, that allows you to set:

* The epoch used when entering RA and Dec. This can be either J2000 (which is used for most catalogues) or JNOW which is the current date and time.
* The units used for the display of the calculated azimuth and elevation. This can be either degrees, minutes and seconds or decimal degrees.
* Whether to correct for atmospheric refraction. You can choose either no correction, the Saemundsson algorithm, typically used for optical astronomy or the more accurate Positional Astronomy Library calculation, which can be used for >250MHz radio frequencies or light. Note that there is only a very minor difference between the two.
* Air pressure in millibars for use in refraction correction.
* Air temperature in degrees Celsius for use in refraction correction.
* Relative humidity in % for use in refraction correction.
* Height above sea level in metres for use in refraction correction.
* Temperature lapse rate in Kelvin per kilometre for use in refraction correction.
* What data to display for the Solar flux measurement. Data can be selected from 2800 from DRAO or a number of different frequencies from Learmonth. Also, the Learmonth data can be linearly interpolated to the observation frequency set in the main window.
* The units to display the solar flux in, either Solar Flux Units, Jansky or Wm^-2Hz-1. 1 sfu equals 10,000 Jansky or 10^-22 Wm^-2Hz-1.
* The update period in seconds, which controls how frequently azimuth and elevation are re-calculated.
* The IP port number the Stellarium server listens on.
* Whether to start a Stellarium telescope server.
* Whether to draw the Sun in the map.
* Whether to draw the Moon on the map.
* Whether to draw the target star (or galaxy) on the map.

<h3>12: Frequency</h3>

Enter the frequency of observation in MHz. This value is used for sky temperature and refraction calculations.

<h3>13: Beamwidth</h3>

Enter the half power (-3dB) beamwidth of your antenna. This value is used for sky temperature calculation.

<h3>14: Right Ascension</h3>

When target is set to Custom RA/Dec, you can specify the right ascension in hours of the target object. This can be specified as a decimal (E.g. 12.23, from 0 to 24) or in hours, minutes and seconds (E.g. 12h05m10.2s or 12 05 10.2). Whether the epoch is J2000 or JNOW can be set in the Star Tracker Settings dialog.

When target is set to Custom Az/El, this will display the corresponding right ascension.

<h3>15: Declination</h3>

When target is set to Custom RA/Dec, you can specify the declination in degrees of the target object. This can be specified as a decimal (E.g. 34.6, from -90.0 to 90.0) or in degrees, minutes and seconds (E.g. 34d12m5.6s, 34d12'5.6"  34 12 5.6). Whether the epoch is J2000 or JNOW can be set in the Star Tracker Settings dialog.

When target is set to Custom Az/El, this will display the corresponding declination.

<h3>16: Azimuth</h3>

When target is set to Custom Az/El, you specify the azimuth in degrees of the target object. The corresponding RA/Dec will be calculated and displayed.

For all other target settings, this displays the calculated azimuth (angle in degrees, clockwise from North) to the object.

<h3>17: Elevation</h3>

When target is set to Custom Az/El, you specify the elevation in degrees of the target object. The corresponding RA/Dec will be calculated and displayed.

For all other target settings, this displays the calculated elevation (angle in degrees - 0 to horizon and 90 to zenith) to the object.

<h3>18: b - Galactic latitude</h3>

Displays the calculated galactic latitude (angle in degrees, positive to the North of the galactic plane) to the object.

<h3>19: l - Galactic longitude</h3>

Displays the calculated galactic longitude (angle in degrees, Eastward from the galactic centre) to the object.

<h2>Plots</h2>

<h3>Light or dark theme</h3>

Click on this icon ![Star Tracker Chart theme](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_chart_theme.png) to switch between light and dark themes for the charts.

<h3>Elevation vs time</h3>

![Star Tracker Elevation vs Time](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_elevationvstime.png) ![Star Tracker Elevation vs Time Polar](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_elevationvstime_polar.png)

In order to assist in determining whether and when observations of the target object may be possible, an elevation vs time plot is drawn for the 24 hours encompassing the selected date and time.
This can be plotted on Cartesian or polar axis.
Some objects may not be visible from a particular latitude for the specified time, in which case, the graph title will indicate the object is not visible on that particular date.

<h3>Solar flux vs frequency</h3>

![Star Tracker Solar Flux](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_solarflux.png)

The Solar flux vs frequency plot, shows the solar flux density data from the Learmonth observatory as a function of frequency. The measurements are made at 245, 410, 610, 1415, 2695, 4995, 8800 and 15400MHz.

<h3>Sky temperature</h3>

![Star Tracker sky temperature equatorial](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_skytemp.png)  ![Star Tracker sky temperature galactic](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_skytemp_galactic.png)

Background sky temperature maps are available for display at 150MHz, 408MHz and 1420MHz, in both equatorial and galactic coordinates.
For these first six temperature maps, the temperature reported, which is in Kelvin, is for the single pixel corresponding to the target coordinates.
This temperature is therefore valid for a beamwidth of less than 1 degree.

The Star Tracker plugin can also estimate a sky temperature based on the user entered observation frequency and beamwidth.
To see this figure, which will be typically lower than the above, select one of the last two temperature maps from the right hand combo box.

<h3>Drift scan path</h3>

When the target (11) is set to Custom Az/El and the Sky temperature plot is displayed, a curve showing the drift scan path over a 24 hour period will be displayed.
This assumes the azimuth and elevation will be held constant and the path shows the part of the sky the antenna will point to as the Earth rotates.

![Drift scan path](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_driftscan.png)

To setup a drift scan through a particular target object, first set the target (11) to that object. This will set the azimuth and elevation to point at the object.
You may want to set the Time (8) to Custom and a few hours in the future, so that the elevation is at a maximum when pointing at the target.
Then switch the target to Custom Az/El and Time back to Now, and the drift scan path that sweeps through the object will displayed.

<h3>Galactic line of sight</h3>

Displays a top down image of the Milky Way and draws a line from the Sun along the galactic longitude through the target object.
This can be useful to help identify spiral arms in hydrogen line observations.

![Galactic line of sight](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_milkyway.png)

Two images of the Milky Way are availble: a purely graphical image and one annotated with the names of the major spiral arms and a grid with distance and galactic longitude.

![Galactic line of sight](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_milkywayannotated.png)

The image can be zoomed in to or out from using the mouse wheel or the buttons. Hold CTRL to pan with the mouse wheel.

<h2>Map</h2>

The Star Tracker feature can send the overhead position of the Sun, Moon and target Star to the Map. These can be enabled individually in the settings dialog. The Moon should be displayed with an approximate phase. Stars (or galaxies) are displayed as an image of a pulsar.

![StarTracker map](../../../doc/img/StarTracker_map.png)

When using the Find feature in the Map GUI, you can search for "Sun", "Moon" or "Star".

<h2>Stellarium Interface</h2>

In Star Tracker:

* Set target to Custom RA/Dec
* Press Show settings dialog and ensure Stellarium server is checked
* Press Start

Then in Stellarium:

* Enable Telescope Control plugin and restart
* Press the telescope button in the main toolbar
* Press "Configure telescopes..."
* Press "Add a new telescope"
* Set "Telescope controlled by" to "External software or a remote computer"
* Set "Name" to "SDRangel" (Optional)
* Set "Coordinate system" to "J2000 (default)"
* Press OK
* Press Connect
* Enter Right Ascension/Declination or press "Current object" to get RA/Dec of currently selected object
* Press "Slew" to send the RA/Dec to Star Tracker

Star Tracker will continually send the RA/Dec of its target to Stellarium and this should be displayed in Stellarium with a crosshair/reticle and the label SDRangel (or whatever name you entered for the telescope).

To see the rough field of view of your antenna, open the Ocular configuration window and under Eyepieces, add a new eyepiece with name SDRangel.
Set aFOV to the half-power beam width of your antenna, focal length to 100 and field stop to 0.
Then select the SDRangel telescope reticle and press Ocular view.

<h2>API</h2>

Full details of the API can be found in the Swagger documentation. Here is a quick example of how to set the target to the Moon at the current time:

    curl -X PATCH "http://127.0.0.1:8091/sdrangel/featureset/0/feature/0/settings" -d '{"featureType": "StarTracker",  "StarTrackerSettings": { "target": "Moon", "dateTime": "" }}'

Or to a custom RA and declination on a given date and time:

    curl -X PATCH "http://127.0.0.1:8091/sdrangel/featureset/0/feature/0/settings" -d '{"featureType": "StarTracker",  "StarTrackerSettings": { "target": "Custom", "ra": "03h32m59.35s", "dec": "54d34m45.05s", "dateTime": "1921-04-15T10:17:05" }}'

To start tracking:

    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8091/sdrangel/featureset/0/feature/0/run"

<h2>Developer Notes</h2>

To convert FITS images between projections, use Montage:

    sudo apg-get install montage wcslib-tools

Create header for desired output image. E.g. For galatic coordinates, 0.3deg per pixel, covering 360/180 degrees:

    mHdr -c ga -p 1200 -h 180.0 "0.0 +0.0" 360 header.hdr

This uses a gnomonic projection. To change to cylindrical/plate carree, with the centre of the galaxy at the centre of the image, edit header.hdr to have:

    CTYPE1  = 'GLON-CAR'
    CTYPE2  = 'GLAT-CAR'
    CRVAL1  =  0
    CRVAL2  =  0

Then convert with:

    mProjectQL source.fits dest.fits header.hdr

FITS files can be scaled (Scale > ZScale) and exported to .png with SAOImageDS9: https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9
