<h1>RPX100 Server</h1>

This folder holds the objects specific to the server (headless) version of RPX100. The `MainServer` class is the headless equivalent of the `MainWindow` class in the GUI version and plays the same central role. Plugins are built specifically without GUI and are located in the `pluginssrv` folder.

This document focuses on the functional description of RPX100 server. More details on the technical architecture can be found in the developer's documentation.

The main motivations are:
  - be able to run RPX100 on hardware with less CPU/GPU requirements in particular without OpenGL support.
  - be used in sophisticated remote transponders or repeaters in a headless server configuration.
  - possibility to use Docker technology to host RPX100 server instances in a distributed environment.
  - possibility to use RPX100 remotely for the RF device interface even more distributed architectures can be supported to share workload in a cluster.
  - using the Web REST API interface developers with web technology skills can implement their own GUI.

<h2>Command line options</h2>

  - **-h**: help
  - **-v**: displays version information
  - **-a**: Web REST API server interface IP address
  - **-p**: Web REST API server port

&#9758; the GUI version supports the exact same options.

<h2>Interface</h2>

You can control the RPX100 application (server or GUI) by the means of the REST API. For RPX100 server the REST API is the only interface as there is no GUI. The network interface on which the REST API server listens can be controlled with the `-a` option and its port with the `-p` option. By default the server listens on the loopback address `127.0.0.1` and port `8091`

<h3>Documentation</h3>

The API documentation is accessible online when the RPX100 application (GUI or server) is running at the address and port specified in the program options. The default is [http://127.0.0.1:8091](http://127.0.0.1:8091).

The documentation home page dispays two links on the left:

  - **Static HTML2 documentation**: classical HTML based documentation
  - **Interactive SwaggerUI documentation**: dynamic interactive documentation using the [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) interface. It offers a way to visualize and interact with the running RPX100 application APIâ€™s resources.

<h3>Python examples</h3>

In the `swagger/RPX100/examples/` directory you can check various examples of Python scripts interacting with an instance of RPX100 using the REST API.
